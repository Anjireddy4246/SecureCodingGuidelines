# FUNDAMENTALS-0: Prefer to have obviously no flaws rather than no obvious flaws [8]
Creating secure code is not necessarily easy. Despite the unusually robust nature of Java, flaws can slip past with surprising ease. Design and write code that does not require clever logic to see that it is safe. Specifically, follow the guidelines in this document unless there is a very strong reason not to.
