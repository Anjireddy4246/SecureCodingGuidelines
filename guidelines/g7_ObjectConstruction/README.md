 - OBJECT-1: [Avoid exposing constructors of sensitive classes](g7_01)
 - OBJECT-2: [Prevent the unauthorized construction of sensitive classes](g7_02)
 - OBJECT-3: [Defend against partially initialized instances of non-final classes](g7_03)
 - OBJECT-4: [Prevent constructors from calling methods that can be overridden](g7_04) 
 - OBJECT-5: [Defend against cloning of non-final classes](g7_05)
